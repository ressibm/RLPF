# High-Precision Geosteering via Reinforcement Learning and Particle Filters in Python

 This GitHub repository hosts our Python code for integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Particle Filter (PF) to improve decision-making in geosteering, as detailed in "High-Precision Geosteering via Reinforcement Learning and Particle Filters" [ressi2024rlpf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06377).
